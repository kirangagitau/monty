Both stacks and queues in C are data structures that can be implemented using either arrays or linked lists.
A stack in C is nothing but a linear data structure that follows the LIFO rule (Last In First Out). 
In a stack, both insertion and deletion take place from just one end, that is, from the top.
We can implement a stack in C in 2 ways:
Statically: Array implementation of stacks allows the static memory allocation of its data elements. 
It is important to note that in this method, the stack acquires all the features of an array.
Dynamically: Linked list implementation of stacks follow the dynamic memory allocation of its data elements. 
It is important to note that in this method, the stack inherits all the characteristics of a linked list in C.
